class EarlyStopping:
    """
    Early stopping utility to stop training when a monitored metric has stopped improving.
    Attributes:
        patience (int): Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.
        delta (float): Minimum change in the monitored metric to qualify as an improvement.
        monitor (str): Metric to be monitored.
        mode (str): One of {'min', 'max'}. In 'min' mode, training will stop when the quantity monitored has stopped decreasing; in 'max' mode it will stop when the quantity monitored has stopped increasing.
        counter (int): Counts the number of epochs with no improvement.
        best_score (float or None): Best score observed so far.
        early_stop (bool): Whether training should be stopped.
    Methods:
        __call__(**kwargs): Checks if training should be stopped based on the monitored metric.
        reset(): Resets the early stopping state.
